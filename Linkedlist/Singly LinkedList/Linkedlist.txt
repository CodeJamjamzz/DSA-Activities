
--- Linked List ---
    - A different kind of data structure 
    - linear sequence 

Cons:
    - Is more heavy considering that it still need to store a pointer to the next node
    - Access a certain element through traversing the whole list

Pros:
    - better memory utilization
        Linked list is not contigous meaning each node is scattered to different parts of the heap memory 
        but depends on the scenario consdering that elements are found anywhere if there is free space 
    - better data insertion and deletion
    - no initial size

--- ArrayList ---
    - requires free memeory compared to arraylist
    - accesing an index is more faster compared to linked list 
    - if not able to reallocate will return null or 0

Problem:
    - justify initial size

Pros:
    - better memory usage
    - better element access
